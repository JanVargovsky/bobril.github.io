## How to contribute
We really appraise, if you contribute to the documentation. You can contribute through a pull request.

If you consider something as important and it is not described enough here, don't hesitate to fix it or report an issue. 

### Contribution to existing pages
1. Create a fork of the repository 
1. Edit *.md files
    1. If there is a line: `[//]: <> (symlink:'...some path...')` written in metadata of the file, you have to edit the file targeted by symlink directly. It can be another github repository too. After contribution and successful merge, do pull of submodules and push these changes.
1. Create a pull request 

### Create a new page
1. Create a *.md file in the chapter/section you want to contribute to
1. Insert the data below to the top of the file and edit attributes: menuLabel, menuAnchor, previous, next.
``` 
      ---
      metadata:
        menuLabel: "Bobril Node"
        menuAnchor: "menu-bobril-node"
        previous: "virtualDom.md"
        next: "initialization.md"
      ---
      <h2 id='menu-bobril-node'>Basics</h2>
```
1. The attributes ensure the correct configuration of documentation
1. Please be very careful! Documentation's generator is under the hard development and some edge cases 
doesn't have to be handled. The mistakes in this key part of the file (metadata) can cause unexpected behaviour of compilation.

    1. ```git submodule init```
    1. ```git submodule update --recursive --remote```
